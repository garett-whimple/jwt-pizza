# Incident: 2024-04-06 10-32-00

## Summary

Between 10:32 and 10:37 on April 6th, 2024, users experienced 500 errors when using our services. The event was triggered by an issue with the 3rd party JWT pizza creation and verification service that our backend server relies on.

The service disruption occurred unexpectedly with no preceding changes or warning signs. The incident was detected through system alerts, and the team quickly accessed a recovery URL provided by the 3rd party service to restore functionality.

This low-severity incident affected a minimal number of users due to its short duration and quick resolution. No significant volume of support tickets or social media mentions was reported related to this incident.

## Detection

This incident was detected at 10:33 when an alert was triggered indicating that our backend server was receiving 500 errors when calling the JWT pizza factory service. The on-call engineer was immediately notified.

The detection system worked as expected with immediate alerting when the service began failing.

## Impact

For approximately 5 minutes between 10:32 and 10:37 on April 6th, 2024, users experienced 500 errors when using services that depend on our backend server's communication with the JWT pizza factory.

This incident affected a minimal number of users due to the short duration and quick resolution. No support tickets or social media posts were submitted regarding this issue.

## Timeline

All times are local:

- _10:32_ - System working normally
- _10:33_ - Alert received indicating 500 errors when calling the JWT pizza factory service
- _10:34_ - Investigation began, logs reviewed, error confirmed via direct endpoint testing
- _~10:36_ - Recovery URL from 3rd party service accessed, service restored
- _10:37_ - Service functionality verified, incident resolved

## Response

After receiving the alert at 10:33, the on-call engineer immediately began investigating the issue. By 10:34, the engineer had reviewed logs and personally verified the issue by attempting to call the affected endpoint, confirming the 500 errors.

The response was swift and effective with no delays or obstacles encountered during the resolution process.

## Root cause

Dependency on a 3rd party service for critical JWT pizza creation and verification functionality. The 3rd party service unexpectedly failed but provided a recovery mechanism through a URL that, when accessed, restored service functionality.

The exact cause of the 3rd party service failure is unknown as it is outside our direct control.

## Resolution

The service was restored by accessing a recovery URL that was provided in the error response from the 3rd party JWT pizza factory service. After accessing this URL, the service resumed normal functionality.

At 10:37, the endpoint was tested again and confirmed to be working correctly, marking the end of the incident. The quick identification of the recovery method in the error response led to minimal downtime.

## Prevention

No previous incidents with the same root cause have been recorded. This is the first instance of the JWT pizza factory 3rd party service experiencing an outage.

Due to this incident, we will be investigating options to reduce our vulnerability to 3rd party service disruptions.

## Action items

1. Document the recovery procedure involving the URL access in case of future occurrences - Owner: Operations team - Target: 1 week
2. Investigate building our own JWT pizza creation and verification system to eliminate dependency on the 3rd party service - Owner: Engineering team - Target: To be discussed in next sprint planning
3. Implement additional monitoring for the 3rd party service to potentially detect issues before they impact our systems - Owner: DevOps team - Target: 2 weeks
